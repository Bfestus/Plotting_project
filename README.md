## Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Analysis
### Overview:
Purpose: The goal was to analyze vehicle fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using data visualization tools.
### How We Did It:
We imported the dataset and cleaned it using Pandas.
Then, we created charts like histograms to show the distribution of vehicles based on their fuel efficiency.
We also used heatmaps to understand how different factors like engine size and weight impact emissions.
From the heatmap, we dropped columns that didnâ€™t strongly impact the GHG score to make the analysis more focused.
